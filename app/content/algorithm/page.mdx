Algorithm is a sequence of steps that aims to solve a problem. We can think of an algorithm as a recipe, which is a sequence of steps that aims to solve the problem of hunger.

## Algorithm example

### Recipe

1. Put the water to boil
2. Put the pasta in the water
3. Wait 10 minutes
4. Drain the water
